# QuestCraft

Welcome to the **QuestCraft** repository! This project was developed as part of a dissertation to explore the effectiveness of procedural generation (PCG) in quest design within the gaming industry. QuestCraft utilizes Unity and C# to create quests through procedural generation using tags.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Unity**: A powerful game development platform for creating 2D and 3D games.
- **C#**: The programming language used for scripting within Unity.
- **Procedural Content Generation (PCG)**: A technique used to generate game content algorithmically based on tags.

## 📚 Dissertation Overview

In recent years, procedural generation techniques for quest design have gained significant interest, challenging the traditional dominance of handcrafted quests. This dissertation investigates whether procedural generation imposes limitations on quest design and if players can differentiate between procedurally generated quests and meticulously handcrafted ones.

**Key Points:**

- **Effectiveness of Procedural Generation**: PCG enhances replayability, reduces data volume, and generates game assets efficiently.
- **Player Experience**: The research transitions from human testing to AI-based evaluations due to ethical concerns with human participants, exploring how procedural quests compare to human-designed quests.
- **Findings**: Procedurally generated quests can effectively replace designer-crafted quests if implemented with careful consideration.
- **Award**: 1st Degree was achieved. 

## 📂 Repository Contents

This repository includes:

- **Source Code**: All Unity C# scripts and assets used for procedural quest generation.
- **Documentation**: Detailed documentation on the procedural generation process and dissertation findings.
- **Assets**: Game assets and resources used in the development of QuestCraft.
- **Dissertation**: Full pdf dissertation.
